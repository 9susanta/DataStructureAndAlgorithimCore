Big O notation
---------------------------------------------------
Algorithim
-----------
Binary Search : O(log n);
Quick Sort : Uses Devide and Conquer Algorithm which is devide and process. Its has 3 component one is pivot number, Then sub-array/list will hold all lesser number in one, greater number in another.
Sorting Algorithing depends on the constant in Big O notation. Mostly denotated with K
Data Structure
--------------
1. Array
Reading : O(1)
Insert : O(n)
Delete: O(n)

2. Linked List
Reading : O(n)
Insert : O(1)
Delete: O(1)
